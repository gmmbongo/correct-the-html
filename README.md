# Introduction to Programming Exercise - Correct the HTML

## Overview
In this assignment, I will update the tags inside `index.html`. I'll think carefully about which HTML element should be used if there is a need to update it. The content inside the tags can help determine which tag I should use or if it needs to be changed at all. I'll remember to use semantic HTML tags when updating the document where appropriate. If I make the changes correctly, the page will look the same as it did before any changes were made.

I'll remember to update the closing tags when changing an element.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before I begin, I'll ensure I have the following installed:
- **Git**: Version control system to clone and manage the repository.
- **GitHub**: I'll make sure I have an account to sync my repositories to.
- **Code Editor**: Any code editor like Visual Studio Code.

### Cloning the Repository
I'll follow these steps to fork and clone the repository:
1. Open my terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where I want to store the project.
3. Fork the repository.
4. Clone the forked repository to edit on my local computer.

### Viewing the Project
To view the project locally, I can either open the project files in my code editor or open the HTML files in my browser.

## Tasks
Inside `index.html`:
- [ ] Update the HTML tags so that they are correct and semantic.

## Tips
- I'll remember to update the closing tags when changing an element.
- I'll push a commit for each task completed. Include a meaningful commit message.
- Before the above, I'll update the README task list to track my progress. To do this, I'll enter `x` between the brackets.
- I'll get used to using my browser's developer tools now. For now, I'll become familiar with:
  - Using inspector mode to inspect elements.

## Resources
If I get stuck, I'll remember that I have various resources available to me:
- **Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation for HTML, CSS, and Git.
- **Online Tutorials**: Websites like MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and freeCodeCamp.
- **Community**: Ask questions on forums like Stack Overflow or GitHub Discussions.
